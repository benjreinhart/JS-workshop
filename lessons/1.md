Let's talk about JavaScript
===========================

Douglas Crockford in [*JavaScript: The Good Parts*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do):

> JavaScript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser. Its association with the browser makes it one of the
> most popular programming languages in the world. At the same time, it is one of the most despised programming languages in the world. The API
> of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to work with in
> any language. The DOM is poorly specified and inconsistently implemented. This book touches only very lightly on the DOM. I think writing a
> Good Parts book about the DOM would be extremely challenging.

...

> The amazing thing about JavaScript is that it is possible to get work done with it without knowing much about the language, or
> even knowing much about programming. It is a language with enormous expressive power. It is even better when you know what youâ€™re
> doing. Programming is difficult business. It should never be undertaken in ignorance.


Variables and Comments
----------------------

### Variables

Variables begin with `var` keyword and so to create one you would write something like so:

    var variable = "variable";

    var variable1, variable2, variable3;

    var my_variable = "my variable",
        your_variable = "your variable",
        their_variable = "their variable";

Those are all totally valid variables, their only difference being that in the second example the variables are not intialized to any value and therefore it will be undefined until it is assigned a value.

### Comments

Comments begin with two forward slashes `//` and anything on the same line as those two slashes will not be interpreted by JavaScript.
