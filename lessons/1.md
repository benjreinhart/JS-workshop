# Let's talk about JavaScript

Douglas Crockford in [*JavaScript: The Good Parts*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do):

> JavaScript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser. Its association with the browser makes it one of the
> most popular programming languages in the world. At the same time, it is one of the most despised programming languages in the world. The API 
> of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to work with in
> any language. The DOM is poorly specified and inconsistently implemented. This book touches only very lightly on the DOM. I think writing a
> Good Parts book about the DOM would be extremely challenging.
>
> JavaScript is most despised because it isn’t *some other language*. If you are good in *some other language* and you have to program
> in an environment that only supports JavaScript, then you are forced to use JavaScript, and that is annoying. Most people in that
> situation don’t even bother to learn JavaScript first, and then they are surprised when JavaScript turns out to have significant
> differences from the *some other language* they would rather be using, and that those differences matter.
>
> The amazing thing about JavaScript is that it is possible to get work done with it without knowing much about the language, or
> even knowing much about programming. It is a language with enormous expressive power. It is even better when you know what you’re
> doing. Programming is difficult business. It should never be undertaken in ignorance.
