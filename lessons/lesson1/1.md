Let's talk about JavaScript
===========================

Douglas Crockford in [*JavaScript: The Good Parts*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do):

> JavaScript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser. Its association with the browser makes it one of the
> most popular programming languages in the world. At the same time, it is one of the most despised programming languages in the world. The API
> of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to work with in
> any language. The DOM is poorly specified and inconsistently implemented. This book touches only very lightly on the DOM. I think writing a
> Good Parts book about the DOM would be extremely challenging.

...

> The amazing thing about JavaScript is that it is possible to get work done with it without knowing much about the language, or
> even knowing much about programming. It is a language with enormous expressive power. It is even better when you know what youâ€™re
> doing. Programming is difficult business. It should never be undertaken in ignorance.



The console
-----------

The console is the JavaScript REPL (read-eval-print loop). It's where we can type JavaScript statements and expressions and have them evaluated. You access the console in the browser. I prefer using Google Chrome, but there is a console for almost every browser. [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) for Firefox is really popular and you will most likely often hear it referenced/recommended.

Chrome and Safari come with a web inspector and associated developer tools (the console being one of them). However, you must download Firebug for Firefox if you wish to use it.

In Chrome, to open the console you can go to *View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console*. In Firefox, assuming you have downloaded Firebug, you can go to *Tools -> Firebug -> Open Firebug* or there should be a small icon in the bottom right corner of the browser you can click on. Any other browsers should be really similar to the steps above.

Once you open up the console, try typing `alert("Hello World!");` and then hit enter. That should bring up an alert message. This is what mine looks like:

![console, hello world message](https://github.com/benjreinhart/JS-workshop/raw/master/lessons/lesson1/images/console.png)

We will use the console from here on out to test out and demonstrate small bits of code and more.


Variables and Comments
----------------------

### Variables

Variables begin with `var` keyword and so to create one you would write something like so:

    var variable = "variable";

    var variable1, variable2, variable3;

    var myVariable = "my variable",
        yourVariable = 12,
        theirVariable = "Awesome #^&#$((asdajksdnb";

    var what = myVariable + " " + yourVariable + " " + theirVariable;

Those are all valid variables, their only difference being in style and that in the second example the variables are not intialized to
any value and therefore will be undefined until they are assigned a value. You may have as many variables as you want belonging to the same `var` statement if they are separated by commas.

Note that, in more precise terminology, what you are doing is assigning a value (or no value at all) to a reference (a variable) and that the act of doing so is a statement. Statements in JavaScript end in semicolons `;`. In many cases you actually don't need the semicolon but as we'll see later this is bad and can easily lead to errors. Always have semicolons at the end of your JavaScript statements!

You may notice that if you leave the `var` keyword out, the variable will still be initialized (as long as it's being assigned a value at the
time you initialize it). At first, it will seem as though there is no difference between the two, however, by leaving the `var` keyword out you have just created a global variable and that is BAD (more on this later). For now, don't leave out the var keyword!


### Comments

Comments begin with two forward slashes `//` and anything on the same line to the right of the slashes will not be interpreted by JavaScript.

    // This is a comment
    var tobias = "One of the best sitcom characters ever!";

    tobias; // "One of the best sitcom characters ever!"

Note it is totally fine to have a comment on the same line as actual code so long as it's all the way to the right of the code you want executed.

You can even have multiline comments:

    var myVariable = "Some value";

    /*
       noicceeeeeee multiline comment here
       alert("HELLO WORLD");

       the alert function above won't get executed because this is a multiline comment
    */

    myVariable; // "Some value"




Strings and Numbers
-------------------

### Strings

So Far, you've already seen strings. Strings can be anything inside either double or single quotes.

    var myString = "a string!";
    var mySingleQuoteString = ' Another string';

    myString; // "a string!"

    myString.toString(); // "a string!"

    myString.toUpperCase(); "A STRING!"

    // String concatenation
    myString.concat(mySingleQuoteString); // "a string! Another string"
    myString + mySingleQuoteString; // "a string! Another string"

    typeof myString; // "string"


### Numbers

In JavaScript, the data type `Number` is actually a little different than most programming language's version of a numerical data type. In JavaScript, `Number` is the only number type. There is no distinction between a floating point decimal and an integer. This means that `1` and `1.0` are the same. Many other languages (everyone that I've ever used) has a distinction here, which means if you want to perform arithmetic involving a decimal point, you'd have to explicitly specify that it is a float or use some conversion methods. This is avoided in JavaScript and actually saves a lot of headaches.

For instance, if I open my interactive ruby shell up you would notice something like this:

  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :001 > 10 / 3
   => 3
  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :002 > 10.0 / 3
   => 3.3333333333333335

  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :003 > (10).is_a? Integer
  => true 
  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :004 > (10).is_a? Fixnum
  => true
  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :005 > (10).is_a? Float
  => false 

  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :006 > (10.0).is_a? Float
  => true
  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :007 > (10.0).is_a? Fixnum
  => false
  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :008 > (10.0).is_a? Integer
  => false

  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :009 > (10).class
   => Fixnum 
  ruby-1.9.2-p290 :010 > (10.0).class
   => Float 

That's a lot of different classes and data types, and performing math operations on the different data types results in different values. 

+1 for JavaScript just having `Number`!

  10 / 3;
  // 3.3333333333333335

  10.0 / 3;
  // 3.3333333333333335

  typeof 10; // "number"
  typeof 10.0; // "number"

Ahh, that's nice and easy, we don't need to worry about a distinction!



Arrays and Objects
------------------

### Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript (array literals) look similar to most other high-level languages. They use the square bracket notation `[]` and you do not have to specify the length of the array nor the type. Arrays can contain any combination of any types of values you'd like.


  var array = [];
  array.length; // 0

  var array2 = [
  'one', 2, 'three', 4, undefined, null,
  [1, 2, 3], 'six', 'thirty'
  ];

  array2.length; // 9

  array.push("some value"); // 1
  array.length; // 1
  array; // ["some value"]


Although these arrays may look no different than other high-level language's arrays, under the hood they actually operate quite differently than a traditional array. They are actually a JavaScript object, with a key-value pair. They key behaves like the index and value is the data you stored relative to that index.

In JavaScript, an array actually behaves more like the following:

  var array = ['zero', 'one', 'two'];

  array = {
    '0': 'zero',
    '1': 'two',
    '2': 'three'
  };

Although arrays in JavaScript inherit properties from the `Array` object, and not the `Object` object. We'll talk more about this when we talk about prototypes.
