Let's talk about JavaScript
===========================

Douglas Crockford in [*JavaScript: The Good Parts*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do):

> JavaScript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser. Its association with the browser makes it one of the
> most popular programming languages in the world. At the same time, it is one of the most despised programming languages in the world. The API
> of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to work with in
> any language. The DOM is poorly specified and inconsistently implemented. This book touches only very lightly on the DOM. I think writing a
> Good Parts book about the DOM would be extremely challenging.

...

> The amazing thing about JavaScript is that it is possible to get work done with it without knowing much about the language, or
> even knowing much about programming. It is a language with enormous expressive power. It is even better when you know what youâ€™re
> doing. Programming is difficult business. It should never be undertaken in ignorance.



The console
-----------

The console is the JavaScript REPL (read-eval-print loop). It's where we can type JavaScript statements and expressions and have them evaluated. You access the console in the browser. I prefer using Google Chrome, but there is a console for almost every browser. [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) for Firefox is really popular and you will most likely often hear it referenced/recommended.

Chrome and Safari come with a web inspector and associated developer tools (the console being one of them). However, you must download Firebug for Firefox if you wish to use it.

In Chrome, to open the console you can go to *View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console*. In Firefox, assuming you have downloaded Firebug, you can go to *Tools -> Firebug -> Open Firebug* or there should be a small icon in the bottom right corner of the browser you can click on. Any other browsers should be really similar to the steps above.

Once you open up the console, try typing `alert("Hello World!");` and then hit enter. That should bring up an alert message. This is what mine looks like:

![console, hello world message](https://github.com/benjreinhart/JS-workshop/raw/master/lessons/lesson1/images/console.png)

Next, try typing the following:

```
console.log("I'm printing something to the screen");
```

The `console.log` function will print something out to the screen.

We will use the console from here on out to test out and demonstrate small bits of code and more.


Variables and Comments
----------------------

### Variables

Variables begin with `var` keyword and so to create one you would write something like so:

```
var variable = "variable";

var variable1, variable2, variable3;

var myVariable = "my variable",
    yourVariable = 12,
    theirVariable = "Awesome #^&#$((asdajksdnb";

var what = myVariable + " " + yourVariable + " " + theirVariable;
```

Those are all valid variables, their only difference being in style and that in the second example the variables are not intialized to
any value and therefore will be undefined until they are assigned a value. You may have as many variables as you want belonging to the same `var` statement if they are separated by commas.

Note that, in more precise terminology, what you are doing is assigning a value (or no value at all) to a reference (a variable) and that the act of doing so is a statement. Statements in JavaScript end in semicolons `;`. In many cases you actually don't need the semicolon but as we'll see later this is bad and can easily lead to errors. Always have semicolons at the end of your JavaScript statements!

You may notice that if you leave the `var` keyword out, the variable will still be initialized (as long as it's being assigned a value at the
time you initialize it). At first, it will seem as though there is no difference between the two, however, by leaving the `var` keyword out you have just created a global variable and that is BAD (more on this later). For now, don't leave out the var keyword!


### Comments

Comments begin with two forward slashes `//` and anything on the same line to the right of the slashes will not be interpreted by JavaScript.


```
// This is a comment
var tobias = "One of the best sitcom characters ever!";

console.log(tobias); // "One of the best sitcom characters ever!"
```


Note it is totally fine to have a comment on the same line as actual code so long as it's all the way to the right of the code you want executed.

You can even have multiline comments:

```
var myVariable = "Some value";

/*
   noicceeeeeee multiline comment here
   alert("HELLO WORLD");

   the alert function above won't get executed because this is a multiline comment
*/

console.log(myVariable); // "Some value"
```



Primitive Data Types and Built-in Objects
-----------------------------------------

JavaScript has three primitive data types: `string`, `numeric` and `boolean`.

JavaScript also has four built-in objects, (we could also think of these as classes): `String`, `Number`, `Object` and `Array`.

The `String` object wraps the primitive data type `string`, providing it with a number of methods and properties. The `Number` object does the same for the `numeric` primitive data type. `Object` and `Array` objects provide methods and properties for JavaScript's built-in data structures. `Object` is also the granddaddy of any JavaScript object and therefore all other objects inherit from it.

JavaScript has two special types that represent non-existance, `null` and `undefined`.

It also has `NaN` to represent something that is Not a Number.

```
parseInt("string"); // NaN
```


Strings and Numbers
-------------------

### Strings

So Far, you've already seen strings. Strings can be anything inside either double or single quotes.

```
var myString = "a string!";
var mySingleQuoteString = ' Another string';

console.log(myString); // "a string!"

myString.toString(); // "a string!"

myString.toUpperCase(); "A STRING!"

// String concatenation
myString.concat(mySingleQuoteString); // "a string! Another string"
myString + mySingleQuoteString; // "a string! Another string"

console.log(typeof myString); // "string"
```

### Numbers

In JavaScript, the primitive data type `numeric` is actually a little different than most programming language's version of a numerical primitive. In JavaScript, `numeric` is the only numerical type. There is no distinction between a floating point decimal and an integer. This means that `1` and `1.0` are the same. Many other languages (everyone that I've ever used) has a distinction here, which means if you want to perform arithmetic involving a decimal point, you'd have to explicitly specify that it is a float or use some conversion methods. This is avoided in JavaScript and actually saves a lot of headaches.

For instance, if I open my interactive ruby shell up you would notice something like this:

```
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :001 > 10 / 3
 => 3
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :002 > 10.0 / 3
 => 3.3333333333333335

ruby-1.9.2-p290 :003 > (10).is_a? Integer
=> true 
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :004 > (10).is_a? Fixnum
=> true
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :005 > (10).is_a? Float
=> false 

ruby-1.9.2-p290 :006 > (10.0).is_a? Float
=> true
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :007 > (10.0).is_a? Fixnum
=> false
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :008 > (10.0).is_a? Integer
=> false

ruby-1.9.2-p290 :009 > (10).class
 => Fixnum 
ruby-1.9.2-p290 :010 > (10.0).class
 => Float 
```

That's a lot of different classes and data types, and performing math operations on the different data types results in different values. 

+1 for JavaScript just having just the `numeric` primitive!

```
console.log(10 / 3); // 3.3333333333333335

console.log(10.0 / 3); // 3.3333333333333335

console.log(typeof 10); // "number"
console.log(typeof 10.0); // "number"
```

Ahh, that's nice and easy, we don't need to worry about a distinction!



Objects and Arrays
------------------

### Objects

Object literals in JavaScript are key-value pairs. They can be accessed by either square bracket notation `[]` or by the dot `.` notation. However, the dot notation has a few caveats.

```
var object = {
  'key': 'value'
};

console.log(object.key); // 'value'
```





### Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript look similar to most other high-level languages. They use the square bracket notation `[]` and you do not have to specify the length of the array nor the type ahead of time. Arrays can contain any combination of any data types and values you'd like.

```
var array = ['zero', 'one', 'two'];
array.length; // 3

var array2 = [
  'one', 2, 'three', 4, undefined, null,
  [1, 2, 3], 'six', 'thirty', { 'key': 'value' }
];

array2.length; // 10
```

Did you notice something weird about `array.length`? It's missing the parenthesis `()` for normal function invocation. That's because `length` is just a property on a JavaScript object and not a function. That's right, arrays in JavaScript are nothing more than JavaScript objects (with the exception that they have their own literal format).

Let's look more closely:

```
var array = ['zero', 'one', 'two'];

/*
  the array variable above actually looks like this internally:

  var array = {
    '0': 'zero',
    '1': 'one',
    '2': 'two',
    'length': 3
  };

  array['0']; // 'zero'
*/

array[0]; // 'zero'

// You can even access an array literal with a string, just like you would with an object. Either way,
// when an object literal or array literal get evaluated, the value inside the brackets gets converted
// to a string.

array['0']; // 'zero'

```

What happens is that the JavaScript interpreter actually converts a value of type `Number` to a string and stores them as a property with an associated value, just like the JavaScript `Object`. Since JavaScript objects aren't super performant in terms of lookup times, arrays in JavaScript do not have the lookup time performance benefits they do in many other languages.

Although arrays in JavaScript are JavaScript objects internally, they inherit properties from `Array`'s prototype (`Array.prototype`), and not `Object`'s prototype (`Object.prototype`), which gives them a handful of useful methods that allow us to treat them like lists and not key-value pairs. We'll talk more about prototypes, methods and inheritance later.

The distinction between arrays and objects can be confusing, like Douglas Crockford said in *JavaScript: The Good Parts*:

> JavaScript itself is confused about the difference between arrays and objects.

```
var array = ['zero', 'one', 'two'];
typeof array; // "object"
```

If we want to know if an object is an array, we could use `instanceof`.

```
var array = ['zero', 'one', 'two'];
array instanceof Array; // true
```
